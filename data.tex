\chapter{Data}

Explain the Proto0 and LNGS datasets. For Proto0 look at Luzzi's thesis. For
LNGS I should probably link some slides and explain what I know.

Put 2D histograms of all datasets I used, apart from when there are multiple
files with the same configuration. Plot an histogram of all the LNGS triggers
together to reassure the reader that I can assume the trigger position for
files without trigger.
