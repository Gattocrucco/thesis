Explain the Proto0 and LNGS datasets.

For LNGS: the system is probably the one in \cite{savarese2018} which should be
the same as in \cite{acerbi2017}.

For Proto0: \nolinkurl{Report_v1 Report on DAQ operation of MB1 test setup at
CERN.pdf}, page 1 and 2; \nolinkurl{Kish_DS_CollabMeeting-Nov2019_Naples_Proto0
DarkSide Proto-0 activities.pdf};
\nolinkurl{Darkside_general_meeting_Napoli_Last updates on the tests and the
next steps toward DS Proto 1ton.pdf}, pages 12--18;
\nolinkurl{14656-Luzzi-magistrale.pdf}.

Put some example 2D histograms, not the ones that I will put in the individual
chapters.

\cite[p.~2, after eq.~5]{nagy2014} says that they use a short wavelength (blue)
laser such that photons get absorbed directly in the junction and not in the
neutral region below and then diffuse. What's the situation in LNGS?

For the TF2 report: A. Razeto, L. Consiglio, and G. Korga, Traces for LFoundry
Tile 15, collected in February 2021.
