\chapter*{Introduction}

The goal of this thesis is to do some studies on the silicon photomultipliers
(SiPMs) photodetection modules (PDMs) that will be used in the DarkSide20k dark
matter detection experiment, needed in order to decide some details of the data
acquisition system (DAQ) and of the layout of the readout electronics. Similar
work in the DarkSide collaboration has been reported in \cite[chapters~3
and~5]{savarese2018}.

\marginpar{Officially, is it photo\emph{detection} or \emph{detector} modules?}

The thesis is divided in eight chapters. The first two chapters provide a brief
introduction to dark matter and to the DarkSide experiment. They do not contain
new material and are included only for the sake of completeness.
Chapter~\ref{ch:data} is a reference for the sources of the datasets used in
the analyses. Chapters~\ref{ch:snr}, \ref{ch:timeres} and~\ref{ch:rate} deal
with the performance of single pulse detection in the PDM output (signal to
noise ratio, temporal resolution, and fake rate). Chapter~\ref{ch:anal}
analyzes additional pulses noise (cross talk and afterpulsing).

This layout has more chapters than is currently conventional for this kind of
document. This is done to keep each somewhat self-contained topic well
separated, such that it should be quicker to pull out specific information.

To the same end, for each figure and table we provide a Python script that
reproduces the content. Each script is referenced at the end of the caption
like this: \scriptlink{fignoise.py}. The link is to a preview of the file in an
online repository, \url{https://github.com/Gattocrucco/sipmfilter}. To run
these scripts, clone or download the repository. The scripts are located in the
directory \nolinkurl{figthesis}. The file \nolinkurl{README.md} provides detailed
instructions on how to set up the working environment.

Some scripts require no input. Others require large data files which are not
included in the repository. Of the latter, some have a cache of the data they
need, others just can not be executed without the original data. For people
outside of the DarkSide collaboration it may not be possible to obtain the data
files; in any case, they can check what the code is doing exactly.

The \LaTeX{} code for this thesis is itself available at
\url{https://github.com/Gattocrucco/thesis}. Moreover, the
\nolinkurl{sipmfilter} repository contains slides on this work which we
presented at DarkSide meetings. The Python code is covered by the MIT license,
while the thesis and the slides are covered by the CC-BY~4.0. These licenses
grant anyone the right to reuse this material, even without releasing
themselves the modifications as open source, provided they cite the original
author and keep the copyright and license notices. The licenses do not cover
figures which we copied from other sources nor the DarkSide data.
