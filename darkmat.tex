\chapter{Dark matter}

Random notes:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Say why the dark matter can not form sort of a parallel universe with
    planets systems life etc. (no autointeraction).
    
    \item Find a reference for the dark matter not autointeracting, some
    convincing reasoning, the fact that it can not even form black holes by
    random fluctuation.
    
    The main point I think is the fact that the dark matter halo has the shape
    of a sphere (how is this determined?), it would be a disk if it had
    friction.
    
    \item I consider it a great victory for physicists that most of the matter
    in the universe is like an ideal fluid from a physics textbook.

\end{itemize}
