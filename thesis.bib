@article{tulin2018,
	abstract = {We review theories of dark matter (DM) beyond the collisionless paradigm, known as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and their observable implications for astrophysical structure in the Universe. Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of ΛCDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core--cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations. We provide a summary and critical look for all current constraints on DM self-interactions and an outline for future directions.},

	abstract = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 (z = 0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

	abstract = {We use stellar kinematics from the latest Gaia data release (DR2) to measure the local dark matter (DM) density ρDM in a heliocentric cylinder of radius R= 150 pc and half-height z= 200 pc. We also explore the prospect of using our analysis to estimate the DM density in local substructure by setting constraints on the surface density and scale height of a thin dark disk aligned with the baryonic disk and formed due to dissipative dark matter self-interactions. Performing the statistical analysis within a Bayesian framework for three types of tracers, we obtain ρDM = 0.016 $\pm$ 0.010 M⊙/pc3 for A stars; early G stars give a similar result, while F stars yield a significantly higher value. For a thin dark disk, A stars set the strongest constraint: excluding surface densities (5--12) M⊙/pc2 for scale heights below 100 pc with 95\% confidence. The upper bound of this constraint implies ≲ 1\% of the Milky Way DM mass is present in a dissipative dark sector. Comparing our results with those derived using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, we find that the uncertainty in our measurements of the local DM content is dominated by systematic errors that arise from assumptions of our dynamical analysis in the low z region. Furthermore, there will only be a marginal reduction in these uncertainties with more data in the Gaia era. We comment on the robustness of our method and discuss potential improvements for future work.},

	abstract = {The idea of dark matter enjoys popular support, but two major concerns persist: the so-called Standard Model excludes it, and it cannot be directly detected by any telescope. For now, astronomers can only observe dark matter{\textquoteright}s influence indirectly, such as when watching unseen creatures perturb the surface of a pond. Harvey et al. observed 72 galaxy collisions to compare the resulting centers of mass for the gas and stars (from direct observations) and for the dark matter (by inference). Based on these offsets, dark matter is clearly present.Science, this issue p. 1462 Collisions between galaxy clusters provide a test of the nongravitational forces acting on dark matter. Dark matter{\textquoteright}s lack of deceleration in the {\textquotedblleft}bullet cluster{\textquotedblright} collision constrained its self-interaction cross section σDM/m \&lt; 1.25 square centimeters per gram (cm2/g) [68\% confidence limit (CL)] (σDM, self-interaction cross section; m, unit mass of dark matter) for long-ranged forces. Using the Chandra and Hubble Space Telescopes, we have now observed 72 collisions, including both major and minor mergers. Combining these measurements statistically, we detect the existence of dark mass at 7.6σ significance. The position of the dark mass has remained closely aligned within 5.8 {\textpm} 8.2 kiloparsecs of associated stars, implying a self-interaction cross section σDM/m \&lt; 0.47 cm2/g (95\% CL) and disfavoring some proposed extensions to the standard model.},

@article{vogelsberger2012,
	abstract = {{We present N-body simulations of a new class of self-interacting dark matter models, which do not violate any astrophysical constraints due to a non-power-law velocity dependence of the transfer cross-section which is motivated by a Yukawa-like new gauge boson interaction. Specifically, we focus on the formation of a Milky-Way-like dark matter halo taken from the Aquarius project and resimulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowed parameter space of this new model. We find that for these cases, the main halo only develops a small core (∼1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical to that of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. Neither the subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes is altered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner density structure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. As a consequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloes differ significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstrate that they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario. Specifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloes that are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of the Milky Way dSphs. We conclude that these models offer an interesting alternative to the cold dark matter model that can reduce the recently reported tension between the brightest Milky Way satellites and the dense subhaloes found in cold dark matter simulations.}},

	abstract = {For a given photon detection efficiency (PDE), the primary, Poisson distributed, dark count rate of the detector (DCR0) is one of the most limiting factors affecting the timing resolution of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) in the scintillation light readout. If the effects of DCR0 are removed through a suitable baseline compensation algorithm or by cooling, it is possible to clearly observe another phenomenon that limits the PDE, and thus the timing resolution of the detector. It is caused by the optical crosstalk of the SiPM, which is significantly increased by the presence of the scintillator. In this paper, we describe this phenomenon, which is also easily observed from the reverse I--V curve of the device, and we relate it to the measured coincidence resolving time in 511 keV γ-ray measurements. We discuss its consequences on the SiPM design and, in particular, we observe that there is an optimal cell size, dependent on both SiPM and crystal parameters, that maximizes the PDE in presence of optical crosstalk. Finally, we report on a crosstalk simulator developed to study the phenomenon and we compare the simulation results obtained for different SiPM technologies, featuring different approaches to the reduction of the crosstalk.},

	abstract = {Different applications require different customizations of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) technology. We present a review on the latest SiPM technologies developed at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK, Trento), characterized by a peak detection efficiency in the near-UV and customized according to the needs of different applications. Original near-UV sensitive, high-density SiPMs (NUV-HD), optimized for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) application, feature peak photon detection efficiency (PDE) of 63\% at 420 nm with a 35 um cell size and a dark count rate (DCR) of 100 kHz/mm2. Correlated noise probability is around 25\% at a PDE of 50\% at 420 nm. It provides a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 100 ps FWHM (full width at half maximum) in the detection of 511 keV photons, when used for the readout of LYSO(Ce) scintillator (Cerium-doped lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate) and down to 75 ps FWHM with LSO(Ce:Ca) scintillator (Cerium and Calcium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate). Starting from this technology, we developed three variants, optimized according to different sets of specifications. NUV-HD&ndash;LowCT features a 60\% reduction of direct crosstalk probability, for applications such as Cherenkov telescope array (CTA). NUV-HD&ndash;Cryo was optimized for cryogenic operation and for large photosensitive areas. The reference application, in this case, is the readout of liquid, noble-gases scintillators, such as liquid Argon. Measurements at 77 K showed a remarkably low value of the DCR of a few mHz/mm2. Finally, vacuum-UV (VUV)-HD features an increased sensitivity to VUV light, aiming at direct detection of photons below 200 nm. PDE in excess of 20\% at 175 nm was measured in liquid Xenon. In the paper, we discuss the specifications on the SiPM related to different types of applications, the SiPM design challenges and process optimizations, and the results from the experimental characterization of the different, NUV-sensitive technologies developed at FBK.},

	abstract = {Building on the successful experience in operating the DarkSide-50 detector, the DarkSide Collaboration is going to construct DarkSide-20k, a direct WIMP search detector using a two-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 t (20 t). This paper describes a preliminary design for the experiment, in which the DarkSide-20k LAr TPC is deployed within a shield/veto with a spherical Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV) inside a cylindrical Water Cherenkov Veto (WCV). This preliminary design provides a baseline for the experiment to achieve its physics goals, while further development work will lead to the final optimization of the detector parameters and an eventual technical design. Operation of DarkSide-50 demonstrated a major reduction in the dominant 39Ar background when using argon extracted from an underground source, before applying pulse shape analysis. Data from DarkSide-50, in combination with MC simulation and analytical modeling, shows that a rejection factor for discrimination between electron and nuclear recoils of {\$}>3 {$\backslash$}times 10\^{}{\{}9{\}}{\$}is achievable. This, along with the use of the veto system and utilizing silicon photomultipliers in the LAr TPC, are the keys to unlocking the path to large LAr TPC detector masses, while maintaining an experiment in which less than {\$}< 0.1{\$}events (other than {\$}{$\backslash$}nu{\$}-induced nuclear recoils) is expected to occur within the WIMP search region during the planned exposure. DarkSide-20k will have ultra-low backgrounds than can be measured in situ, giving sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of {\$}1.2 {$\backslash$}times 10\^{}{\{}-47{\}}{\$}cm2 ({\$}1.1 {$\backslash$}times 10\^{}{\{}-46{\}}{\$}cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2 (10 TeV/c2) mass, to be achieved during a 5 yr run producing an exposure of 100 t yr free from any instrumental background.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.}},

	abstract = {Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM), also called Solid State Photomultipliers (SSPM), are based on Geiger mode avalanche breakdown that is limited by a strong negative feedback. An SSPM can detect and resolve single photons due to the high gain and ultra-low excess noise of avalanche multiplication in this mode. Crosstalk and afterpulsing processes associated with the high gain introduce specific excess noise and deteriorate the photon number resolution of the SSPM. The probabilistic features of these processes are widely studied because of its significance for the SSPM design, characterization, optimization and application, but the process modeling is mostly based on Monte Carlo simulations and numerical methods. In this study, crosstalk is considered to be a branching Poisson process, and analytical models of probability distribution and excess noise factor (ENF) of SSPM signals based on the Borel distribution as an advance on the geometric distribution models are presented and discussed. The models are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental probability distributions for dark counts and a few photon spectrums in a wide range of fired pixels number as well as with observed super-linear behavior of crosstalk ENF.},

@article{nagy2014,
	abstract = {Crosstalk and afterpulsing in silicon photomultipliers can strongly limit the photon-counting resolution and dynamic range of the sensors. In this work we present a method and a measurement (as a demonstration) to separate the afterpulse and delayed crosstalk components of the delayed correlated pulses in STMicroelectronics silicon photomultiplier signals. The contribution of delayed crosstalk can be significant since even if one suppresses afterpulses by applying a longer recharge time, the delayed crosstalk component remains unaffected. This was the case for our measurement: 207ns recharge was long enough to suppress afterpulses (3.3\%), while the delayed crosstalk remained large (12.8\%).},

@inproceedings{garutti2014,
	abstract = {Radiation hard SiPMs are strongly demanded for the application in the LHC detectors. Examples are the LHCb fiber tracker, the CMS outer calorimeter, and for future application in detectors for ILC, as well as for space detectors. Radiation doses up to a few times 1012neq/cm2 are expected at the positions of the SiPMs at LHC. Dedicated studies on the effects of radiation on SiPMs are required to improve the performance of the existing devices. The effects of proton and neutron radiation on silicon crystals are well known. Macroscopically, they lead to the reduction of the signal, the increase of noise and the alteration of the electric field. In SiPMs defects formed in the vicinity of the narrow multiplication region (up to 2-3 μm from the surface) have an impact on the device operation. In this paper we focus on the investigation of various noise sources, generation and recombination (or dark noise), noise induced by de-trapping (or afterpulses), and optical cross-talk between pixels. We attempt to establish a method to separate the afterpulse contribution of noise and determine the de-trapping time constant and the afterpulse probability as a function of temperature and excess bias voltage. We found that afterpulses in a particular KETEK SiPM can be described with the use of one characteristic de-trapping time constant of the order of 75 ns. We present a series of irradiation studies performed on few samples of SiPMs from KETEK exposed to a neutron fluence of 1-10×1010neq/cm2. After such irradiations, while the SiPM static parameters do not change significantly, the noise increases by 3 orders of magnitude, posing serious limitations to their usage. Unfortunately, with such an increase we have not managed to disentangle the afterpulse contribution from the noise.},

@article{chmill2017,
	abstract = {Methods are developed, which use the pulse-height spectra of SiPMs measured in the dark and illuminated by pulsed light, to determine the pulse shape, the dark-count rate, the gain, the average number of photons initiating a Geiger discharge, the probabilities for prompt cross-talk and after-pulses, as well as the electronics noise and the gain fluctuations between and in pixels. The entire pulse-height spectra, including the background regions in-between the peaks corresponding to different number of Geiger discharges, are described by single functions. As a demonstration, the model is used to characterise a KETEK SiPM with 4384 pixels of 15μm×15μm area for voltages between 2.5 and 8V above the breakdown voltage. The results are compared to other methods of characterising SiPMs. Finally, examples are given, how the complete description of the pulse-eight spectra can be used to optimise the operating voltage of SiPMs, and a method for an in-situ calibration and monitoring of SiPMs, suited for large-scale applications, is proposed.},
