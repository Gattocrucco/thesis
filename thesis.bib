	abstract = { The geometric Poisson distribution (also called P{\'o}lya--Aeppli) is a particular case of the compound Poisson distribution. We propose to express the general term of this distribution through a recurrence formula leading to a linear algorithm for the computation of its cumulative distribution function. Practical implementation with a special care for numerical computations is proposed and validated. The article ends with an example of application of these results for the computation of pattern statistics in biological sequences modelized by a Markov model. },

@article{vinogradov2012,
	abstract = {Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM), also called Solid State Photomultipliers (SSPM), are based on Geiger mode avalanche breakdown that is limited by a strong negative feedback. An SSPM can detect and resolve single photons due to the high gain and ultra-low excess noise of avalanche multiplication in this mode. Crosstalk and afterpulsing processes associated with the high gain introduce specific excess noise and deteriorate the photon number resolution of the SSPM. The probabilistic features of these processes are widely studied because of its significance for the SSPM design, characterization, optimization and application, but the process modeling is mostly based on Monte Carlo simulations and numerical methods. In this study, crosstalk is considered to be a branching Poisson process, and analytical models of probability distribution and excess noise factor (ENF) of SSPM signals based on the Borel distribution as an advance on the geometric distribution models are presented and discussed. The models are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental probability distributions for dark counts and a few photon spectrums in a wide range of fired pixels number as well as with observed super-linear behavior of crosstalk ENF.},

@article{nagy2014,
	abstract = {Crosstalk and afterpulsing in silicon photomultipliers can strongly limit the photon-counting resolution and dynamic range of the sensors. In this work we present a method and a measurement (as a demonstration) to separate the afterpulse and delayed crosstalk components of the delayed correlated pulses in STMicroelectronics silicon photomultiplier signals. The contribution of delayed crosstalk can be significant since even if one suppresses afterpulses by applying a longer recharge time, the delayed crosstalk component remains unaffected. This was the case for our measurement: 207ns recharge was long enough to suppress afterpulses (3.3\%), while the delayed crosstalk remained large (12.8\%).},

@inproceedings{garutti2014,
	abstract = {Radiation hard SiPMs are strongly demanded for the application in the LHC detectors. Examples are the LHCb fiber tracker, the CMS outer calorimeter, and for future application in detectors for ILC, as well as for space detectors. Radiation doses up to a few times 1012neq/cm2 are expected at the positions of the SiPMs at LHC. Dedicated studies on the effects of radiation on SiPMs are required to improve the performance of the existing devices. The effects of proton and neutron radiation on silicon crystals are well known. Macroscopically, they lead to the reduction of the signal, the increase of noise and the alteration of the electric field. In SiPMs defects formed in the vicinity of the narrow multiplication region (up to 2-3 μm from the surface) have an impact on the device operation. In this paper we focus on the investigation of various noise sources, generation and recombination (or dark noise), noise induced by de-trapping (or afterpulses), and optical cross-talk between pixels. We attempt to establish a method to separate the afterpulse contribution of noise and determine the de-trapping time constant and the afterpulse probability as a function of temperature and excess bias voltage. We found that afterpulses in a particular KETEK SiPM can be described with the use of one characteristic de-trapping time constant of the order of 75 ns. We present a series of irradiation studies performed on few samples of SiPMs from KETEK exposed to a neutron fluence of 1-10×1010neq/cm2. After such irradiations, while the SiPM static parameters do not change significantly, the noise increases by 3 orders of magnitude, posing serious limitations to their usage. Unfortunately, with such an increase we have not managed to disentangle the afterpulse contribution from the noise.},

@article{chmill2017,
	abstract = {Methods are developed, which use the pulse-height spectra of SiPMs measured in the dark and illuminated by pulsed light, to determine the pulse shape, the dark-count rate, the gain, the average number of photons initiating a Geiger discharge, the probabilities for prompt cross-talk and after-pulses, as well as the electronics noise and the gain fluctuations between and in pixels. The entire pulse-height spectra, including the background regions in-between the peaks corresponding to different number of Geiger discharges, are described by single functions. As a demonstration, the model is used to characterise a KETEK SiPM with 4384 pixels of 15μm×15μm area for voltages between 2.5 and 8V above the breakdown voltage. The results are compared to other methods of characterising SiPMs. Finally, examples are given, how the complete description of the pulse-eight spectra can be used to optimise the operating voltage of SiPMs, and a method for an in-situ calibration and monitoring of SiPMs, suited for large-scale applications, is proposed.},
